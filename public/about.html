<p>
  Having worked as an implementation engineer at amagi media labs for 1 year and 3 months put me in a dynamic working environment <br />
  where I was exposed to high pressure and narrow deadlines as a fresher. This experience has helped me build my level-headedness mentality. <br />
  I have the experience of understanding and implementing new methodologies firsthand and then training my peers on the same. <br /><br />

  I'm an explorer of my interests and a self motivated individual working to make his mark in the industry.<br /><br />

  Think Hard -- Work Smart
